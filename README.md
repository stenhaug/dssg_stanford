## Stanford Data Science for Social Good
Welcome to the Stanford Data Science for Social Good summer program!

### What is the Stanford DSSG program?
The Stanford DSSG program trains aspiring researchers to work on real-world data science problems with social impact. 

### Program Norms
1. Be on time (things start and end on time)
2. Give and receive feedback
3. Communicate
4. Don't interrupt
5. Limit electronic distractions
   * No phones or social media during activities
6. Be present and engaged!

We created a list of Norms as a group - the google doc is located [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HP1NXb5GQ01RU16QnEu72Q1PcNe8NA2Cwcst4_Dehrk/edit).

### Code of Conduct
This program abides by the Stanford [Code of Conduct](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-1/subchapter-1/policy-1-1-1).

### Culture
Our ultimate goal is to create a psychologically warm, safe, and productive environment for learning. 

Please reach out to the technical mentors or faculty at any point in time.
If you have a concern that you would like to submit anonymously, you can do so [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmiXSa1d4n_qEcD7jvVSpCY3LN4_tKHal6Lgi2zQ4eflMmWA/viewform) at any point during the program.

### High-Risk Data
Make sure to follow appropriate [practices](resources/high_risk_data.md) for working with high risk data.

### Organization and Links
We have organized the materials for the summer on the group [GitLab](https://code.stanford.edu/dssg_stanford) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/174A-mKJi0dqYN8NNDzNI1OE90bSEE4Ig). 
GitLab contains code and the course site. We are using Google Drive primarily for Documentation and organizing shared files (e.g. powerpoints).

The structure of the `dssg_stanford` GitLab repository is as follows:
```
 |---- README.md            <--- main page
 |---- resources/           <--- helpful resources
         |---- tech_setup/  <--- for setting up GitLab, etc
         |---- reference/   <--- reference materials for EDA, workflow, git, etc
 |---- daily_material/      <--- what we did each day, organized by week (updated at the end of the day)
 |---- labs/                <--- individual learning activities
```

Other code is located in project-specific repositorities on GitLab (for the platelet project, this is `platelet_processing`). We will create other repositories with this soon. 
Documentation for the platelet project will all be on the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1n8nHCkGfctX7iPJfWo1N06dgoRBcnBtI).

#### Tips
**Make sure you are up-to-date!** In your repository - `git pull origin master` to update!
**Note**: feel free to edit this repo and put in pull ("merge") requests to get the edits on the website.
