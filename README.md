## Stanford Data Science for Social Good
Welcome to the Stanford Data Science for Social Good summer program!

### What is the Stanford DSSG program?
The Stanford DSSG program trains aspiring researchers to work on real-world data science problems with social impact. 

### Program Norms
We created a list of Norms as a group at the beginning of the program, they are located [here](resources/program_norms.md)

### Code of Conduct
This program abides by the Stanford [Code of Conduct](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-1/subchapter-1/policy-1-1-1).

### Culture
Our ultimate goal is to create a psychologically warm, safe, and productive environment for learning. 

Please reach out to the technical mentors or faculty at any point in time.
If you have a concern that you would like to submit anonymously, you can do so via this  [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmiXSa1d4n_qEcD7jvVSpCY3LN4_tKHal6Lgi2zQ4eflMmWA/viewform) at any point during the program.

### High-Risk Data
Make sure to follow appropriate [practices](resources/high_risk_data.md) for working with high risk data.

### Organization and Links

We have organized the materials for the summer on the group here and in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/174A-mKJi0dqYN8NNDzNI1OE90bSEE4Ig). We are using Google Drive primarily for Documentation and organizing shared files (e.g. powerpoints). 

Go to this [page](overview.md) for schedules and links to the training materials. 

The structure of the `dssg_stanford` GitHub repository is as follows:
```
 |---- README.md            <--- main page
 |---- overview.md          <--- schedule of trainings and talks
 |---- resources/           <--- helpful resources
         |---- tech_setup/  <--- for setting up GitLab, etc
         |---- reference/   <--- reference materials for EDA, workflow, git, etc
 |---- w1_w2/               <--- what we did each day for 1st 2wks (updated at the end of the day)
 |---- labs/                <--- individual learning activities
```

Student code is located in private project-specific repositorities on [Stanford GitLab](code.stanford.edu).
