### DAY FIVE: Starting exploratory data analysis

In the morning, Ben gave a session on how to use ggplot in R to explore the platelet data. The code for this session is [here](https://code.stanford.edu/dssg_stanford/platelet_processing/tree/master/exploratory_analysis).

John Chambers came and gave a talk at lunch. 

In the afternoon, we worked on exploring our datasets more, and reported what we found to the rest of the group.

We ended the day with a feedback and working session.
