```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
# install.packages("tictoc")
library(tictoc)
```

Create data

```{r}
n_cols <- 100000

df <- 
    rerun(n_cols, rnorm(10)) %>% # how many times to re-run, generate 10 numbers from a standard normal
    as_tibble(.name_repair = "universal") # to generate names of columns (otherwise will throw an error)
```

An example of telling time

```{r}
tic()
median(df$...1)
toc()
```

# Many ways to calculate the median of each column

For each way, describe what the code is doing, grade the speed, and grade the human readability.

## Way 1

What's the code doing? taking the median of each column and then appending it
Two vectors in memory before rewrite

Speed: this was slow. maybe creating intermediate data structures

Human readability:

```{r}
tic()
output1 <- vector("double", 0)
for (i in seq_along(df)) {
    output1 <- c(output1, median(df[[i]]))
}
toc()
```

## Way 2
What's the code doing?

Create a list, and then add to it --> saves tons of time

Speed: Fast. Renaming in place

Human readability:


```{r}
tic()
output2 <- vector("double", ncol(df))
for (i in seq_along(df)) {
    output2[[i]] <- median(df[[i]])
    }
toc()
```

## Way 3

What's the code doing?

Speed: 

Human readability:

```{r}
tic()
ouput3 <- apply(df, 2, median)
toc()
```

## Way 4

What's the code doing?

Speed:

Human readability:

```{r}
tic()
output4 <- lapply(df, median)
toc()
```

## Way 5

What's the code doing?

Speed:

Human readability:

```{r}
tic()
output5 <- df %>% map(median)
toc()
```

## Way 6

What's the code doing?

Speed:

Human readability:

```{r}
# install.packages("furrr")
library(furrr)
plan(multiprocess)

tic()
output6 <- df %>% future_map(median)
toc()
```

## Way 7

What's the code doing?

Speed:

Human readability:

```{r}
# install.packages("parallel")
library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)

tic()
output7 <- 
    parLapply(
        cl, 
        df,
        median
    )
toc()
```

## Way 8

What's the code doing?

Speed: SLOWWWW

Human readability:

```{r}
tic()
output8 <- df %>% summarize_all(median)
toc()
```
