### Code Review Instructions

Select a piece of code that you feel is *yours* and go over it with your neighbor. The code must be on GitLab.  The reader should take about 10 minutes to look at and provide feedback in the form of an “Issue” on GitLab. Also, while you are working together, your neighbor should explain to you what the code is doing. 

For feedback, focus on:
* Comments/narrative
* Is it clear what is going on? Do the comments and text (e.g. markdown in RMarkdown) give the reader enough information to understand the code?
* Naming
* Are the variable and function names informative?
* Modularity
* Does the code make appropriate use of functions?
* Are there long chunks of repeated code?

By the end of the day, make sure to address this, push, and Close the Issue.
