### Final Deliverable
The goal of this deliverable is to hand off the project to your partner. Summarizing and communicating your results is an important part of being a data scientist.

You will hand your partner a well-written report that:
- describes your results in a cohesive **narrative**
- contains **figures and tables** that support this narrative
- points to a well-organized gitlab repository containing your **code** 

This should be one single document that exists in both editable and PDF form. This document should enable someone who has not been working on the project to understand what you have done and reproduce your analysis.

We have had you submit [weekly deliverables](weekly_deliverable.md) to get better at describing your work and work toward this final goal. We expect you will be able to draw from your prior work to help you to create a clear, cohesive description of your analysis. 

Send the document via email to the mentors and faculty for feedback by 5pm on Tuesday 9/10. You will (electronically) hand the document to your partner at your final meeting with them.  

#### Guidelines for structuring your deliverable
Provide a less than 1 page abstract summarizing the problem and what you did.

Then in more detail:
**Background**
- Describe the overarching problem
- Describe the subproblem you are working on and what your partner is looking for
- Describe the dataset you are working with

**Results**
For each analysis you performed:
- What was the analysis?
- Why did you do this analysis?
- What are the results of your analysis? 
- What are the limitations of your results?

**Conclusions**
- What are the overall conclusions and limitations of your work? 
- Suggestions for future work?

Include an **appendix** that describes your code and code organization, and how to set up and run your code. 

A **table of contents** and headers may be helpful for organization.


#### Guidelines for Handing over Code
Include a README file in the parent directory that explains how to run the analysis and lists all dependencies (what did you install?). Your code should be clearly documented and organized, and include all steps for how you got from the provided data to the output.

#### Constructing a Data Science Story
Constructing a clear data science narrative that describes your results is an important part of being a data scientist.

Here is an example of a well-written narrative on [college admission discrimation](http://obsessionwithregression.blogspot.com/2017/08/testing-for-discrimination-in-college.html) from Emma Pierson’s obsession with regression blog
Brad Efron’s paper on [Shakespeare’s words](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335721?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) is an excellent example of a clear and well-crafted statistical story. Notice that it starts with a simple description of what the data is. It is a good idea to use data as a “hook” for your narrative.

#### Reproducibility
One would think that computational work should be much easier to reproduce than other fields; however, more often than not, it is the case that you go to reproduce someone else’s analysis and cannot because it was not adequately described and/or the code is not clear or available. 

David Donoho describes [why we should work reproducibly](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/11/3/385/257703), including how it is important for testing validity and having work build on each other. See this helpful article on [guidelines](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) for reproducible computational work.
