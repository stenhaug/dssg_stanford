### Git and GitLab Introduction

### Why version control? What is git?
Git is a version control software. It was designed to help people track changes and collaborate on large software projects.

### Why GitLab?
GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are three platforms built around git. They include user interfaces that make collaboration and project management easier. We are using Stanford GitLab instead of GitHub because it allows us to create shared repositories that are hosted at Stanford. 
(Note: even though the repository is at Stanford, do not push the data that is on Nero. It is fine (and we encourage you!) to push your code!)

### Quick intro to git
We've defined the following commands: Repository, Commit, Branch, Diff, Remote, Push, Pull, Clone, Fork

You will learn lots more about using git this summer, this is just a quick intro so we can get going :P
