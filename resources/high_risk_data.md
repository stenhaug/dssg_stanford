### Working with High-Risk and Sensitive Data
This summer, the projects will work with sensitive data. You completed HIPAA and CITI trainings to help prepare you to work with these data. 

The data has been de-identified to remove all HIPAA identifiers; however, because of the sensitive nature of these projects, it is important to take caution when using these data. We will be going over this in detail during the Data Privacy and Security session on Thursday. 

The main key points are:
1. **The data stays on Nero!**
    + Do not copy the data to your computer or any other location!
    + Do not take screenshots of the data.
    + Do not push the data to github.
2. Do not show the data to anyone outside of the program.
3. Do not attempt to re-identify the data!
    + If a field has been de-identified (we used a hash), do not use other external knowledge or linking to other data or any other process to re-identify it.
4. If you have questions about the data - please ask the technical mentors, faculty, and project partners. 
    + If you need to send an email that may be sensistive or transfer sensitive material, you can use [Stanford Secure email](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/secureemail) and/or [Stanford Medicine Box](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/box). Ask technical mentors to help with this. 
5. We are working with .Rmd files a lot - make sure sensitive data is not included in the markdown - the markdown is what is saved, the code output is not. Do not commit html files. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. It is better to ask and learn than to do something that breaches data security! There is no question too trivial to ask here.

*Mistakes sometimes do happen. Be very careful and diligent to avoid these, but if there is a mistake, it is important to report it immediately. Stanford has systems in place for handling this.*
