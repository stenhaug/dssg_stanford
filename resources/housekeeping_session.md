## Housekeeping session

Everything is on GitLab and Google Drive for now!

Now, let's move things around to make it consistent.

### Moving things around in GitLab
Individual activities will be done in GitLab in the relevant repository in your branch. 

We need to move a couple files into the `platelet_processing` repository.

0. Switch to your branch and make sure you pushed your code from this morning.
  `git push origin <your_branch>`

1. Pull from master to make sure you are up-to-date
  `git pull origin master`

2. Tidyr intro: move `tidyr_intro.Rmd` into `activities/tidyr_07_16/tidyr_intro_<sunet>_07_16.Rmd`

3. Move code from yesterday into `activities/eda_07_22/eda_qs_<sunet>_07_22.Rmd`
    
4. Push the code to your branch:
  `git push origin <your_branch>`

5. Put in a merge request on GitLab.

We will work in these workspaces from now on.
We are also going to remove the `course_materials` repository because it is now redundant. It is up to you whether you want to delete your forked repo - I recommend you do, but you do not have to.
