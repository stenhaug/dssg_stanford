### Guidelines for Developing Deliverables
Every week you are expected to submit:
  - at least 1 RMarkdown file containing code and images
  - documentation of what you did (either in the Rmarkdown file or in a separate file), and a recap of conversations with partners
  - a text file describing what you worked on -and- the links to the code on GitLab + paths to the data on Nero; this file will be emailed to the technical mentors
    * this is extremely necessary for us to be able to figure out what you did and how to give feedback!

You also need to present for **10 minutes max** a summary of what you did as a group. This should be a cohesive and concise summary that includes visuals and demonstrates your work as a group. 

Deliverables must be realistic, specific, and work towards your final goal. You should have something to show and ask of your partners each week, and this should contribute to that without losing sight of the final goal. Project scoping is challenging! We will keep iterating and you will get better at this skill.

Key Questions for Project Scoping:
  1. What do you want to get done?
  2. Who do we need to reach out to? (What phone calls do we have? What do you need to be doing?)
  3. How do we make sure that each of us is learning what we want to be learning?
  

Other things to consider:
  - What is the project's overall goal?
  - What did you do last week?
  - What needs to be done next? How does this contribute to the overall goal? Does this step need to be done?
  - What can we realistically do of this in the next week? (Rule of thumb: I often divide this in half, everything takes longer than expected)
  - How will we do this in a well documented, reproducible fashion?
  - How will we divide up this task among the group?
