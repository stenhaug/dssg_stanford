### Server directory structure

Let's get comfy with the Nero!

We will be using bash commands to take a look at the directory structure. If you're not familiar with bash, the main two commands you need today are:
   * `cd` to change to a directory
   * `ls` to list files within a directory
If you are interested, here is a quick bash essentials [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/raineorshine/9898350#file-bash-essentials-sh). We will be going over this and other bash commands in more detail as you need it.

Directory paths:
 * `/home/<sunet>/` or `~`: this is your home directory. This is where you want to work on your code. Only you can access this directory.
 * `/share/pi/dssg/` - this is the location for all DSSG shared folders. Within this directory, there will be some educational materials (under `materials/`, we will use this tomorrow), and the project directories
  * under `platelet/`, we have the following:
      - `input_data/` - this is where the data is located. Note - you can only **read** from this directory, you cannot **write** to it.
      - `collab_files/` - this is for you and other students to put collaborative folders, you can **read and write** to this directory. Feel free to create folders here for the different parts of the project and tasks.
      

Now you're set up to start looking at data!
