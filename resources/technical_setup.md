## Technical Setup
Let's take a few minutes to make sure we are all on the same page in terms of technical set up. The technical mentors will be walking around - don't hesitate to reach out if you are stuck during this process!

**General Note:

### Accounts


#### GitLab
Because of the sensitive nature of these projects, we will be using the Stanford GitLab. For those who are familiar with GitHub, GitLab is very similar; it also is a collaborative code repository and user interface for git. The two main reasons why we are using it is that (1) it is hosted by Stanford, and (2) it allows us to have a larger private repository.

First go to [code.stanford.edu] - sign in using the button on the top right. You will be prompted to login with your Stanford account. 

Let us know when you have logged in and we will add you to the `dssg_stanford` group. Once you are added, you can see the `summer_materials` repository! This is where we are located right now :P.

#### Slack
We sent out invites to the slack workspace [stanford-dssg.slack.com]. We will be using Slack for communicating. Please let us know if you need us to resend the invite or have a problem accessing this.

#### Google calendar
DSSG is using a Google calendar to keep track of all program events.
It only works with gmail - so slack your gmail account to one of us in a message and then you'll get an invite. Double check you are able to add this to your calendar!

### Connecting to Nero
We will be using [Nero](http://med.stanford.edu/nero.html) this summer. Nero is a server for moderate-to-high risk data. We are using this server because the majority of the data we are using is medical data. We will talk more about this more in detail throughout the program. 

You should have received an email this morning welcoming you to Nero. The instructions from the email are summarized here.


1. Every time you connect to Nero, you **must** be on the Stanford VPN.

   * To set this up, you have to first install the Cisco VPN client. Instructions are [here](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/vpn/). Select your OS under the `Get Started` section to get detailed instructions on how to install and connect to the Stanford VPN on your operating system.
   * Connect to Stanford VPN.

#### Server path directory structure

'/home/<sunet>/'

'/scratch/'

'/share/pi/dssg/' - this is the location for shared folders. 
  * '/input_files/'
  * '/collab_files/'
