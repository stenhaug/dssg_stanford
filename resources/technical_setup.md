## Technical Setup
Let's take a few minutes to make sure we are all on the same page in terms of technical set up. The technical mentors will be walking around - don't hesitate to reach out if you are stuck during this process!


### Connecting to Nero
We will be using [Nero](http://med.stanford.edu/nero.html) this summer. Nero is a server for moderate-to-high risk data. We are using this server because the majority of the data we are using is medical data. We will talk more about this more in detail throughout the program. 

You should have received an email this morning welcoming you to Nero. The instructions from the email are summarized here.


1. Every time you connect to Nero, you **must** be on the Stanford VPN.

* To set this up, you have to first install the Cisco VPN client. Instructions are [here](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/vpn/). Select your OS under the `Get Started` section to get detailed instructions on how to install and connect to the Stanford VPN on your operating system.

'/share/pi/dssg/' - this is the location for shared folders.

### Accounts

#### Slack
We sent out invites to the slack workspace [stanford-dssg.slack.com]. We will be using Slack for communicating. Please let us know if you need us to resend the invite or have a problem accessing this.

#### Google calendar
DSSG is using a Google calendar to keep track of all program events.
To get added to the Google calendar *TODO: DESCRIBE HERE*

#### Github
If you don't have one already, set up a github student account with your Stanford email. This account must be connected to Stanford in order for us to set up private repositories. Once you have a github account, add it to the spreadsheet [here]
