### Weekly Deliverable Guideline

#### Deliverable Schedule
**Monday at 9 am** - whiteboard potential deliverables with your team and then mentors  
**Monday at 11 am** - submit your planning document over email and save to google drive  
**Thursday at 5 pm** - submit your written deliverables and code over email and save to google drive    
**Friday at 1 pm** - 30-minute presentation to mentors, faculty, and other students.   
**Friday by 5 pm** - Mentors will provide feedback to teams.   

Submissions should be sent via email to faculty and mentors.  

#### Planning Document
This should be 1-2 pages and describe in detail what you plan to accomplish this week. The document will contain:  
* Overarching Goal - 1 sentence goal of the project
* Weekly Goal - 1 sentence about the goal this week
* Planned submission - describe what you anticipate you will submit at the end of the week, this should be 1-2 paragraphs or a list
* Week plan - break down tasks by day (we recommend using the calendar to plan this), and list who will be working on what. 

*Example Plan*
Not specific enough: 
 - Clean data
 - Build model

Specific enough: 
 - Quantify missingness in expression data (Monday, Alice), impute using average values
 - Read about time series models, learn how to use R package (Monday, Joe)

When putting this together, make sure to consider the project’s overarching goal (and how you will accomplish this in the time given), who you are meeting with, and your individual learning goals.

The mentors and faculty will approve this document and let you know of adjustments.


#### Written Deliverables and Code
You will be submitting a Weekly Report.

In your email to the mentors, you need to:
* Email your final report - this should be a PDF or HTML from Markdown
* Point to all code (on GitLab) and data used (on Nero)

##### Weekly Report. 
You will turn in the output of a Rmarkdown document (knitted to HTML or PDF) by emailing it to the mentors. We will primarily review this document, it will include code, but should be more focused on clearly describing:
 * What you did
 * The results of this week’s analysis  
We expect you to have written code that supports this analysis (e.g. for file processing, additional exploratory analyses) that is on GitLab, and we will review this as well.

This document should enable someone who has not been working on the project to understand what you have done.

##### Code and data
All code should be described in the email, checked in, well documented. We will be looking at your use of functions, code structure, documentation. Avoid repeated code! “Junk” or scratch code should be removed from the main directory and placed in a scratch or sandbox directory. We will not evaluate this. If you generate intermediate data files, please save them to the `collab_data` folder on Nero.

#### Presentation
This presentation will be to mentors, faculty, and the other group. The goal is to provide an update of what you have done, receive feedback on your work from mentors and fellow students, and practice effective presentation skills.

It must be well put together and presented as a team and should contain visuals. It should have a story. 

The presentation should contain:
* Intro summarizing the big picture, why you are working on what you are
* The results of your analysis, with visuals
* Conclusion summarizing what you said

Each team will have 30 minutes total of which you should plan on presenting 15-20 mins and leaving the rest for conversation. Your team will be in charge of managing that time well which might include things like saying "thanks for your question, we can talk after but we need to move on in the interest of time". We'll have a hard close cutting off at 30 minutes. when someone is speaking, they should be standing ideally.  Lastly, be sure your presentation has an intro (summarizing the goal and context of the project) and conclusion (summarizing what you've said)

The goal of all these deliverables is for us to regularly give you feedback and help you progress through the projects.
