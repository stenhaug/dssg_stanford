## DAY ONE: Setup and familiarize yourself with the data

### Technical Set up
Follow the list of instructions [here](../../resources/technical_setup.md) to make sure you are all set on accounts. 

### Working with Sensitive Data
We are working with sensitive data. It is important to be careful, and follow the procedures listed [here](../../resources/technical_setup.md). 

### Familiarize yourself with the platelet data

For the first couple weeks, we will be all delving deep into the platelet dataset!

Mike provided an intro these platelet data [here]. *TODO - link*

Now it's time to take a look at the platelet data!

1. Log on to Nero (Refer back to the [technical setup](../../resources/technical_setup.md) if you have problems.)

1. We will be using R (and RStudio) for the majority of the program. While we recommend and will primarily be providing support for R, you can use your favorite data analysis tool (R, python, matlab, STATA, etc.) to start data exploration.
*TODO - what is installed on the server? Help with this*


 * Connecting via RStudio (recommended)
  - Open a web browser
  - Login from Jupyter Lab: 
  `https://nero.compute.stanford.edu`
  - In the future, this link may work to go directly to RStudio:
   `nero.compute.stanford.edu/user/<sunet>/rstudio/`
   If it does not, try to log in from Jupyter lab
 * Connecting via SSH:
  - Open terminal and type:  `ssh <sunet>@nero.compute.stanford.edu` 
  - You will be prompted to sign in with your username and password (and two-step authentication)

1. The data are located at `path_name`. *TODO - fill in*
 * Best practices note: you should not edit the input data (you should only read in input data and if you need to write it out, do so in a new file)
 * Look at the directory structure - what directories are there? What files are missing?
 
We will now divide up into groups to better look at the data.

#### List of questions
With your group, go through the files.
1. What is in your directory?
1. What are the data fields?
1. Plot + summarize something

You will then be asked to present this to the rest of the group.
