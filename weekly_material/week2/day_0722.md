We discussed program norms; the results of this discussion are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HP1NXb5GQ01RU16QnEu72Q1PcNe8NA2Cwcst4_Dehrk/edit).

### Intro to Groups 
We divided into two groups for the rest of the summer.

For the platelet project:
 - group A is focusing on predicting wastage
 - group B is focusing on predicting whether patients need a transfusion

The deliverables for the week are described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ioVcHMbbZ_QYaSCyV52srH6M5xQfooTnao6hTctgfw/edit).

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Mike lead a session to come up with qs for exploring the platelet data. 

Questions we came up with are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYT1M6zcNxyzjfQLplrZmXzV0iXPiCw0BKxGggEPO7M/edit).

As we come up with qs that we need to ask for help on (from Naras or Tho), put them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cCIEgWqr4PveubLF9QSw1E1AwfpJ31T0G7zpaLRLy4M/edit). This is a central location to store the data questions.
